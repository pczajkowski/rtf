I've created this library for my job and thought will share as maybe somebody else would find it useful. Right now it's able to do one thing, enable tracked changes for given RTF file.

See tests to get familiar with the usage.

Don't know if I'll add more functionality in the future, it may be left as-is forever. As always you're using it at your own risk. Enjoy.
